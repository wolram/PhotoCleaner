```
Drowning in thousands of photos? SnapSieve is the intelligent photo cleanup tool that helps you reclaim your storage and organize your memories.

Your Mac's photo library grows every day with duplicates, near-identical shots, and blurry images you forgot to delete. SnapSieve uses advanced computer vision to automatically find these space-wasters and help you keep only your best shots.

POWERFUL DUPLICATE DETECTION
SnapSieve uses Apple's Vision framework to detect exact and near-exact duplicates with precision. The app compares photos at a deep visual level, not just by filename or size, ensuring you catch every duplicate hiding in your library.

SMART SIMILAR PHOTO GROUPING
Took 20 shots of the same sunset? SnapSieve groups visually similar photos together using perceptual hashing and intelligent clustering. Review entire groups at once and easily pick your favorites while removing the rest.

QUALITY ASSESSMENT
Every photo is analyzed for aesthetics, blur, and exposure. SnapSieve grades your photos from A to F, making it easy to identify and remove low-quality images that are just taking up space.

BATTLE MODE - THE FUN WAY TO CHOOSE
Cannot decide which photo to keep? Enter Battle Mode! Your photos compete in a tournament-style bracket where you pick the winner in each round. Watch as confetti celebrates your champion photo. It is the most entertaining way to curate your collection.
